# CS 1001 Prelab Book

## Compiling

- You'll need Pandoc 1.19 or later.
- `make` builds a final copy of the book.
- `make quick` runs `pdflatex` only once; it's faster for checking some things but labels, images, etc. may not be correct.

## Project Wishlist

- Build an index
- Glossary
- Build teacher edition / student edition
    - Mark certain blocks as "teacher only"
- Questions pages, ability to build a separate PDF for each question set
    - Plenty of room for students to write responses
    - Probably want to include a place for their name.

## Formatting TODOs

- Notepad++ looks way better if the ++'s are written in texttt (i.e., Notepad`++`)
