# Exploring Text Editors

## Motivation

At this point your Computer Science career, you've worked with at least one text editor: `jpico`.
Love it or hate it, `jpico` is a useful program for reading and writing **plain ASCII text**.
C++ programs[^others-too] are written in plain ASCII text.
ASCII is a convenient format for humans and programs[^compilers] alike to read and process.

Because of its simple and featureless interface, many people find editors like `jpico` to be frustrating to use.
Many users miss the ability to use a mouse or simply copy/paste lines from files without bewildering keyboard shortcuts.

Fortunately, there are myriad text editors available.
Many of the more popular options are available to you on campus machines and can be installed on your person computers as well!
These editors offer many features that may (hopefully) already be familiar to you.
Such features include:

- Syntax highlighting
- Cut, copy, and paste
- Code completion

Whether you're writing programs, viewing saved program output, or editing Markdown files, you will often find yourself in need of a text editor.
Learning the features of a specific text editor will make your life easier when programming.
In this lab, you will try using several text editors with the goal of finding one that fits your needs.

Several of the editors you will see do not have a graphical user interface (GUI).
Although the ability to use a mouse is comfortable and familiar, don't discount the console editors!
Despite their learning curves, many experienced programmers strongly prefer console editors due to their speed, stability, and convenience.
Knowing a console editor is also handy in situations where you need to edit files on a machine halfway around the globe[^globe]!

**Note:** This chapter focuses on text editors; integrated development environments will be discussed later in the semester.
Even if you prefer to use an IDE for development, you will still run into situations where a simple text editor is more convenient to use.

### Takeaways

- Recognize the value of plain text editors.
- Familiarize yourself with different text editors available on campus machines.
- Choose a favorite editor; master it.
